Assignment from NBS to create a laravel application following through a bootcamp at https://bootcamp.laravel.com/.

The bootcamp utilizes Laravel Sail which allows interaction with the docker environment, Laravel Breeze for its authentication purposes, and Vue.js for its frontend.

This bootcamp teaches us on how to create "Chirper", which is essentially a mini blog application where users can register and add short messages, or chirps, to the blog. Users are also able to edit and delete their own chirps.

Also, the bootcamp teaches us how to send "email" notification to other users when a chirp has been made. This can be seen via MailHog which catches the emails from the application for testing purposes.

Note. The only part of the bootcamp that was not done was the deployment, which require the use of a cloud server(Linode, DO, AWS, ...) and Laravel Forge
